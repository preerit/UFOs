# UFOs

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
A data scientist wants to write about her hometown McMinville Oregon that is famous for its UFO sightings and holds an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. The data scientist is an UFO enthusiast herserlf too. She has a JS file filled with UFO sightings with details on countries, states, cities, types of sightings, etc. In this analysis, the data scientist visualizes the data as a table with filters to sift tthrough the data and manipulate the data better. The article on hometown's UFO sightings will be online, she puts together a HTML page with the article, the table of data to support her findings, and easy to use filters to fine tune the results.

----

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
The following image shows the webpage overview.
